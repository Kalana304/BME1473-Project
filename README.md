# Signal Processing Techniques to Improve Feature Space for EEG-based Epileptic Seizure Detection

<p align="justify"> 
Bio-signal processing is an evolving field of science that is critical in the diagnosis, and prognosis of diseases 
and timely intervention to reduce the impact of the disease on the patients. In recent years, the research 
interests have been largely shifted to analyze the functionality of the brain to identify the structural and 
functional changes and characteristics that correspond to different types of neurological disorders including
epileptic seizures, and Alzheimerâ€™s. In this project, the broad objective is oriented toward detecting epileptic 
seizures by analyzing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded in-vivo from the patients diagnosed 
with the disease.
